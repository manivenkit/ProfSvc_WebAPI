I was getting pension, through DoT paid by India Post, with FMA till Jan 2021.
My PPO is: TA/PEN/MHTC/BTC/RV/803.
FMA component was stopped w.e.f. Jan 2021 and CPGRAMS request was raised vide DOPPW/E/2021/06921. It was clarified by CCA Mumbai that FMA is applicable to me and asked DAP to draw the same and pay to me, but DAP Nagpur refused to accede to the same, and on clarificatory CPGRAMS complaint they quoted a circular for P&T pensioners to stop the FMA component. The officer at DAP who called me said this circular is not applicable to DoT pensioners but is bound by the circular issued by PMG, Navi Mumbai. When I retired in June 1991, my area was not covered under CGHS and I have never been informed by my Audit office which is CCA Mumbai, or any circular has been issued by the CCA, that FMA is not applicable on my pension, for whatever reasons, in fact they have said vide the above request that I am eligible for FMA. Latest communication with CCA says they have followed up with DAP and no response has been received.
Hence please state:
1. Is CCA the final authority or DAP, Nagpur to decide in my case w.r.t. the pension components payable?
2. Is DAP authorized to take decision in contravention of CCA orders for telecom pensioners?
3. Is the FMA component payable on my pension, as per the confirmation given by CCA? If Yes under what circumstances was this stopped? If No, please state the reasons and/or OM issued in this matter.
4. Any other information which can be shared relevant to above information solicited in achieving a final closure to this issue.

The information so sought may be please shared in electronic format with copy to CCA and DAP for further action.
